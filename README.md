# \<image-carousel\>

It's a carousel element for Polymer 2.0.

## Installation

  bower i --save image-carousel


## Example


```html
<image-carousel aria-label="example carousel">
  <template is="dom-repeat" items='["https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1217/4607963354_e1a8fea210_z.jpg", "https://cs1.livemaster.ru/storage/e6/45/00b119c13ed9f8b4dc6363a60d--materialy-dlya-tvorchestva-nabor-dlya-vyshivki-biserom-belyj-ti.jpg", "https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=ORT.TH_470633631&pid=1.12&eid=G.470633631"]' slot="images">
    <img src="[[item]]" class="scrolling-images" alt$="demo image alt [[index]]" width="100px" height="350px">
  </template>
</image-carousel>
```

## Usage

Please keep following points in mind while using the element

- As images will be part of `light-dom` please add property/attribute `slot="image"` to the container of the images (template in above example).
- Images should have class named `scrolling-images` (Defining the class in not necessary, just add the attribute to image element).
- In case, you want to change images dynamically do call `computeNumberOfImages` function afterwards.  Carousel will fire `image-carousel-changed` event once all the changes are done. You can listen for it to do/read any further changes.


```javascript
// assuming id of image-carousel element on which change needs to be done is image-carousel
this.$['image-carousel'].addEventListener('image-carousel-changed', () => {
  //further action goes here
});
```

- As efforts have been made to keep this element accessible please add `alt` attribute to image tag and [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute) or [aria-labelledby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-labelledby_attribute) to image-carousel.

Web accessibility refers to practice of making web easily usable/accessible for people with disabilities.

Implementing accessibility (also known as WAI-ARIA, ARIA, a11y) in your project isn't as tough as it may look, it has been well documented by w3c and you read the documentation [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#usage). You can also look at some of there [examples](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/).
